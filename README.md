# Memory Game Project

## Description
This is a classic concentration-style game. You need to identify the eight matching pairs of cards.

To play, click on a card to reveal its symbol. Then click on a second card. If the symbols match, they will stay overturned, and you are one step closer to winning. If they do not match, quickly try to remembe them because they will turn back over soon. Try to find the matching pairs as quickly as you can, because you'll lose a star every 10 moves.

This is Project 2 for the Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree.

## How to Use
After downloading the files and preserving the file structure, open index.html in a browser such as Chrome and you should be able to start playing by clicking on cards.
