# Memory Game Project

## Description
This is a classic concentration-style game. You need to identify the eight matching pairs of cards.

This is Project 2 for the Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree.

## How to Use
After downloading the files and preserving the file structure, open index.html in a browser such as Chrome and you should be able to start playing by clicking on cards.

## Credits
I started from the the [Memory Game starter files provided by Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game)
